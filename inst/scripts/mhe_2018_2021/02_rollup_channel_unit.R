# always the case. Probably makes most sense to just use length_m and diameter_m for imputation (i.e., use all data,
# no need to also use site). I mean, probably always a somewhat consistent relationship btw lenght_m and diameter_m
# for large woody debris, even despite the species of "wood" and site. Interesting conversation on plant evolution
# there! Let's impute length_m and diameter_m themselves, using default values. There doesn't seem to be any other
# vars in the rollup df that makes sense to use.

# 1. maximum_depth_m & thalweg_exit_depth_m

#      channel units, and so this will be largely resolved. But in 2019/2020, do we need to impute and/or
#      estimate ocular estimates, perhaps using information from pebble counts (where available)
